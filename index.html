<h2 class="titletop"> A Bite Into My Life: </h2>
<p> 
I am originally from Bloomingdale, IL, a nice little town in the northwest suburbs of Chicago. My family has a tendency to move around a lot which may sound stressful to have to keep starting over, but we have kept the moving around within the same two towns! It sounds like non-sense, and to some it may be, but until recently no house seemed quite the right fit. Now I am finally settled in a home in Roselle, IL. I haven&#146;t spent much time in our new home yet since I have been living in Iowa City for the past 4 years but that is what it takes to get an education!
</p>

<p>
Speaking of Iowa City, I am a student at Tippie College of Business, a part of the University Of Iowa. I gained a desire to attend school there after visiting and gaining a love for the atmosphere and people that came along with it. Starting out as an accounting major I was determined to find passion in what I was learning, but after being admitted to the accounting program I realized I no longer had an interest in pursuing that major. From there I decided I would go with finance since I still enjoyed working with numbers and understood the concepts that came along with them from a business perspective. My other major, which is the reason I am doing this web page, is one that was newly introduced to Tippie students. I am now part of the few students at Tippie that are pursuing a degree Business Analytics and Information System, also known as BAIS. I am excited to be wrapping up my undergrad in the next year and getting out in the work force to show others what I am truly capable of.
</p>

<p>
Now outside of my school life I do enjoy a large range of other things. To start, my family is one of my biggest passions in life, and I would not be where I am today without them. They have helped me grow as a person by providing me with opportunists I am extremely grateful for, but at the same time kept me humble and down to earth. My friends take up another huge chunk of my heart. They make me laugh, call me out when I am being ridiculous, and accept every part of me. I would not have made it through these four years at Iowa without the support from my family and the company of my friends. Besides all that I appreciate the oddities that society comes with. There is no such thing as normal and I admire the people that are willing to be a part of this complex culture without conforming to society.
